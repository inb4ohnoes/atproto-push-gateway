# Localization

The gateway sends notification `title` and `body` in **English only**. Localization is intentionally a client-side concern.

## Why server-side localization is not implemented

Server-side localization would require either:

1. A `locale` field on every `registerPush` call, persisted per token. The gateway would then format `title`/`body` using a per-locale template map at dispatch time.
2. Translating templates per-language inside the gateway, plus a mechanism to refresh the stored locale every time the user changes their OS language.

Both options bind the user's *device* language to a value stored server-side at registration time. That value goes stale the moment the user switches their OS locale and never auto-refreshes. They also push translation maintenance (DE, FR, JA, …) into a Go service that has no other UI surface.

The client already knows the device locale at notification-display time. Doing the rewrite there is cheaper, always current, and keeps translations next to the rest of the app's i18n catalog.

## How clients are expected to localize

The English `title` and `body` shipped by the gateway are a **fallback for clients without a rewrite layer**. Clients that ship a Notification Service Extension (iOS) or a `FirebaseMessagingService` (Android) should:

1. Read the structured `data` fields (`reason`, `actorDisplayName`, `actorHandle`, `reasonSubject`, …) from the push payload.
2. Build a localized `title` + `body` from those fields using their own i18n catalog.
3. Overwrite the OS-displayed text before the notification is presented.

The `data` payload contains everything needed to do this without an API roundtrip — see [`NOTIFICATIONS.md`](./NOTIFICATIONS.md) for the field list.

### Required iOS behavior

The gateway sets `mutable-content: 1` on every APNs payload (both direct APNs and via Expo Push). An NSE in the client app will be invoked automatically and can rewrite `bestAttempt.title` / `bestAttempt.body` before calling `contentHandler`.

### Required Android behavior

By default the FCM payload includes a `notification` block. When the app is backgrounded, Android renders that block directly via the OS and never wakes the app — so the client cannot intercept it. To allow client-side rewriting, the gateway must send a **data-only** message (no `notification` field) so the registered `FirebaseMessagingService` fires for every push, regardless of foreground state.

**Set `FCM_DATA_ONLY=true`** to switch direct FCM delivery to data-only. In that mode the gateway:

- omits the top-level `notification` block and the `android.notification` block (either one would make FCM treat the message as a notification message and skip the client when backgrounded);
- keeps `android.priority: high` so the message still wakes a dozing app;
- carries the English `title`/`body` and the `channelId` (the `reason` value) inside the `data` payload, so a client can show the English fallback and pick the right channel itself.

The client's `FirebaseMessagingService.onMessageReceived` then fires for every push and builds a localized, OS-displayed notification from the `data` fields.

This is a **deployment-wide** switch rather than a per-registration capability flag. A per-call `clientFormats` field was considered but rejected: `registerPush` is forwarded and validated against the official lexicon by the user's PDS, which may strip or reject unknown fields. Since a self-hosted gateway typically serves a single app (or a known set that all ship a `FirebaseMessagingService`), a deployment switch is both simpler and more robust.

> **Trade-off:** with `FCM_DATA_ONLY=true`, an Android client that does *not* implement a `FirebaseMessagingService` will receive the push but display nothing while backgrounded. Only enable it when every Android client of this deployment handles data messages.

> **Expo note:** this switch applies to **direct FCM** only. Android pushes routed through the Expo Push API (`ExponentPushToken[...]`) are unaffected; localization there depends on the `expo-notifications` background handler.

## Prior art

The Bluesky social-app (`bsky.app`) does **not** localize push notifications either — title/body are always English on both iOS and Android. Their NSE only mutates badge count, chat sound, and communication-notification metadata; their Android `BackgroundNotificationHandler` only sets the channel ID. This gateway's stance is the same as theirs, with the explicit option for downstream clients to do better.

## Field stability

Clients localize against `data.reason` values and the structured author/subject fields. Those identifiers (`like`, `repost`, `reply`, `mention`, `quote`, `follow`, `like-via-repost`, `repost-via-repost`, `verified`, `unverified`) and field names (`actorDid`, `actorDisplayName`, `actorHandle`, `actorAvatar`, `recipientDid`, `uri`, `subject`, `reasonSubject`) are part of the gateway's stable contract — they will not be renamed without a version bump. New reasons will be added with new identifiers; existing ones will not change semantics.

The English `title` and `body` strings are **not** considered stable. They may be reworded for clarity at any time. Clients that depend on them verbatim (rather than treating them as a fallback) will break.
